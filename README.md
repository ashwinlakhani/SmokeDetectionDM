# SmokeDetectionDM

This is our Data Mining PROJECT  of the topic **Smoke Detection**.
This project requires us to create and train a model using different regressors which determine the best accuracy for each algorithm
In the end we create a confusion matrix for these regressors and conclude our project.

A smoke detector based on image and video.
Early warning of fire disaster is one of the important usage of smoke detection. Smoke detector which based on video or image can avoid interference of environmental especially in open or lager spaces and outdoor environments.Generally speaking, video based smoke detection methods distinguish smoke from non-smoke objects based on some distinctive features such as motion, edge, color and texture.
