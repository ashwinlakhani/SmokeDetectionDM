# Smoke Detection 

My Team and I developed and trained our model in the following domain: **Smoke Detection**. This smoke detection works on sensor data. Our dataset is a very advanced form of dataset , containing more than 60 thousand different types of data gathered from the most diverse and extreme sources. This dataset was used to train the model , to develop an advanced and a modern smoke detecting equipment Since the goal is to develop a smoke detecting device powered by AI,IOT devices are used to collect training data.
We have created and trained our model on different algorithms such as  Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier and  determine the best accuracy for each algorithm
Finally, we have summarized and created reports for all the algorithms following which, feature importance was performed for the top algorithms with all data and results plotted and visualized graphically .
